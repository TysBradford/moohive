# Brand Guidelines

## Brand Identity

### Name

**MooHive**

A distinctive, memorable name for the community where AI video creators thrive. "Hive" speaks to collective energy — a community buzzing with shared purpose and mutual support.

### Tagline

**Where AI video creators thrive**

The tagline centers the community. It's not about the platform — it's about the creators who make it valuable.

- **Primary**: Where AI video creators thrive
- **Expanded**: The community where AI video creators showcase, learn, and connect
- **Aspirational**: Home of the AI video movement

### Brand Essence

MooHive is a creator-first community. The platform exists to serve the people who are pioneering AI video — giving them a dedicated space to be seen, to share how they work, and to find their people. We believe the best creative communities are built on transparency, generosity, and mutual respect.

### Brand Promise

We give AI video creators the recognition and connections they deserve — and we'll never put the platform ahead of the community.

### Design Standard

**MooHive is a premium brand. The UI and UX must reflect that at every level.**

The experience should feel hand-crafted and made with love — every interaction considered, every pixel intentional, every animation purposeful. This is not a startup MVP with "good enough" design. This is award-calibre work from day one.

**Core Design Principles**

- **Elegant and sophisticated** — refined, confident, never cluttered or loud
- **Clear visual identity** — instantly recognisable, cohesive across all touchpoints
- **Obsessive attention to detail** — micro-interactions, spacing, transitions all matter
- **Made with love** — the care we put in should be felt by everyone who uses it

We should expect to win top design awards for this work.

**What this means in practice:**

- Generic patterns and templates are unacceptable
- Every component should feel considered, not assembled
- White space is a feature, not wasted real estate
- Subtle polish (shadows, transitions, hover states) distinguishes premium from pedestrian
- The UI should feel warm and human, not cold and corporate

The platform frames creator content — it never competes with it. But the frame itself must be beautiful.

## Visual Identity

### Logo

The logo must work at small sizes and alongside the vibrant, high-contrast video content that dominates the platform. It should feel distinctive yet sophisticated, reflecting the community-focused nature of the platform.

**Primary Mark**

- Wordmark-forward: "MooHive" in the primary typeface
- Optional symbol: Community-focused icon (used sparingly)
- Works on both light and dark backgrounds

**App Icon**

- Simplified community symbol
- High contrast for visibility on device home screens
- No wordmark at icon sizes

**Clear Space**

- Minimum clear space: Height of the "B" on all sides
- Never crowd the logo with other elements

**Minimum Size**

- Digital: 80px wide (wordmark), 24px (icon)
- Print: 20mm wide (wordmark), 6mm (icon)

### Colors

The palette is intentionally restrained. Creator content is the star — the UI should frame it, not compete with it. Light mode with a warm, refined aesthetic is the default.

**Primary Palette**

| Name              | Hex         | Tailwind      | Usage                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Linen**   | `#FAF9F7` | custom        | Primary background (warm off-white)    |
| **Charcoal** | `#1C1917` | stone-900     | Primary text, headings                 |
| **Slate**   | `#78716C` | stone-500     | Secondary text, body copy              |

**Secondary Palette**

| Name              | Hex         | Tailwind      | Usage                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Ash**      | `#A8A29E` | stone-400     | Tertiary text, metadata                  |
| **Frost**    | `#E7E5E4` | stone-200     | Borders, dividers                        |
| **Parchment** | `#FAFAF9` | stone-50      | Subtle backgrounds, footer               |
| **Pearl**    | `#F5F5F4` | stone-100     | Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces      |

**Accent Palette**

| Name               | Hex         | Tailwind      | Usage                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Ember**     | `#EA580C` | orange-600    | Hover states, active elements            |
| **Ink**       | `#1C1917` | stone-900     | Primary CTAs, important actions          |

**Functional Colours**

| Name              | Hex         | Usage                          |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Success** | `#22C55E` | Confirmations, positive states |
| **Warning** | `#FACC15` | Cautions, pending states       |
| **Error**   | `#EF4444` | Errors, destructive actions    |

**Usage Guidelines**

- Light backgrounds are default — warm, refined, not sterile white
- Orange (Ember) is used sparingly for hover states and active elements
- Primary CTAs use Ink (stone-900), not orange — keeps focus on the work
- Let video thumbnails provide the colour; UI stays neutral and elegant
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios minimum (AAA preferred for text)

### Typography

Typography is functional and gets out of the way. Clean, readable, modern — it shouldn't call attention to itself.

**Primary Typeface: Inter**

- Usage: All UI text, headings, body copy
- Weights: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semibold)
- Character: Clean, neutral, highly legible at all sizes
- Fallback: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif

**Secondary Typeface: JetBrains Mono**

- Usage: Metadata, technical details (prompts, settings, model names)
- Weights: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium)
- Character: Technical, precise — signals "behind the scenes" information
- Fallback: ui-monospace, monospace

**Type Scale**

| Name    | Size    | Weight   | Usage                              |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Display | 48/56px | Semibold | Hero sections, major announcements |
| H1      | 36/40px | Semibold | Page titles                        |
| H2      | 24/32px | Semibold | Section headings                   |
| H3      | 18/24px | Medium   | Card titles, subsections           |
| Body    | 16/24px | Regular  | Primary content                    |
| Small   | 14/20px | Regular  | Secondary content, captions        |
| Micro   | 12/16px | Medium   | Labels, metadata, tags             |

**Guidelines**

- Favour shorter line lengths (60-75 characters max)
- Use weight and size for hierarchy, not colour variations
- Monospace for anything a creator typed or configured (prompts, settings)

### Iconography

Icons are utilitarian. They aid navigation and comprehension — they're not decorative.

**Style**

- Outlined style, 1.5px stroke weight
- 24px default size, 20px and 16px for compact contexts
- Rounded corners and caps
- Icon library: Lucide (open source, consistent with Inter)

**Principles**

- Every icon must have a clear, singular meaning
- Pair with text labels where possible — don't rely on icons alone
- Keep icon density low; whitespace over icon clutter

### Imagery

On MooHive, creator videos ARE the imagery. The platform doesn't need stock photos or illustrations — the content provides all visual interest.

**Style**

- Video thumbnails are the primary visual element
- Thumbnails should display at high resolution without compression artifacts
- Maintain original aspect ratios; don't force-crop to uniform sizes
- Subtle rounded corners (8px) for thumbnails in feed contexts

**What to Show**

- Creator video work (the whole point)
- Creator avatars (authentic photos preferred)
- Process shots if creators share them (screenshots, workspace photos)
- Tool logos when displaying video metadata

**What to Avoid**

- Generic stock photography
- AI-generated filler imagery (ironic but distracting)
- Overly branded graphics competing with creator work
- Busy patterns or textures that fight with video content

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

MooHive speaks as a peer in the community — not as a corporation talking to users. We're fellow enthusiasts who built a space we wanted to exist. The voice is warm but not effusive, knowledgeable but not preachy, direct but not cold.

**Voice Attributes**

| Attribute                  | What it means                                            | What it's not            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Community-minded** | We speak as "we" (the community), not "we" (the company) | Corporate, distancing    |
| **Generous**         | We share knowledge freely, celebrate others' wins        | Gatekeeping, competitive |
| **Grounded**         | Practical, realistic about the state of AI video         | Hype-driven, breathless  |
| **Curious**          | Genuinely interested in how things work, always learning | Know-it-all, dismissive  |

### Tone Variations

The voice stays consistent; tone shifts based on context.

**Onboarding & empty states**

- Tone: Warm, encouraging, helpful
- Example: "Your portfolio is ready. Add your first video to start building your presence."

**Feature announcements**

- Tone: Excited but grounded
- Example: "You can now filter creators by the AI models they use. Find Sora specialists, Runway wizards, and more."

**Error states**

- Tone: Clear, calm, solution-focused
- Example: "That video URL didn't work. Check the link and try again."

**Community highlights**

- Tone: Celebratory, genuine
- Example: "This week's most-viewed work comes from creators pushing Kling to its limits."

### Writing Guidelines

**Do**

- Use "creators" not "users"
- Say "your work" not "your content"
- Be specific about tools and techniques when relevant
- Write in sentence case (not Title Case For Everything)
- Keep CTAs action-oriented: "Add video" not "Submit"

**Don't**

- Use corporate jargon ("leverage," "synergy," "solutions")
- Overpromise or hype ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Talk down to creators or explain things they already know
- Use exclamation marks excessively!!!!
- Say "simple" or "easy" — let creators judge difficulty

**Example Transformations**

| Instead of                                 | Write                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| "Upload your content now!"                 | "Add your first video"                       |
| "Our platform helps users showcase videos" | "Show your work. Share your process."        |
| "Leverage our powerful discovery features" | "Find creators by style, tool, or technique" |
| "Join thousands of users today"            | "Join the community"                         |

## Messaging Framework

### Positioning Statement

MooHive is where AI video creators build their presence, share their process, and connect with a community that gets what they do.

**Supporting Messages**
