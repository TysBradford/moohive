# MooHive — Distribution Strategy

## Overview

MooHive's growth depends on building a thriving creator ecosystem first. Without quality creator content, there's nothing for hirers to discover. Our distribution strategy prioritizes attracting passionate AI video creators who will become the foundation of the community.

**Core principle:** Creators first, always. A platform with 100 active creators posting great work is more valuable than 10,000 passive accounts.

---

## Growth Phases

### Phase 1: First 100 Creators (Seed)

**Goal:** Hand-pick early creators who will set the quality bar and community tone.

**Strategy: Direct outreach + community presence**

| Tactic | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Personal outreach** | DM 200-300 active AI video creators on X/Twitter. Personalize each message referencing their specific work. Ask them to be "founding creators." |
| **Discord presence** | Join Runway, Pika, Kling, Sora Discord servers. Be genuinely helpful. Share the platform when relevant, never spam. |
| **Reddit engagement** | Active participation across AI video subreddits (see detailed list below). Answer questions, share knowledge. Soft-mention MooHive when appropriate. |
| **Founding creator program** | Offer early creators: verified badges, feature priority, input on roadmap, "Founding Creator" permanent status. |

**Who to target first:**
- Creators with 1K-50K followers (big enough to have quality work, small enough to respond)
- Active posters who share process details already (natural fit)
- Creators frustrated with current showcase options (vocal about pain points)
- Tool-specific power users (known in Runway/Kling/Pika communities)
- **YouTube tutorial creators** (see below)

#### YouTube Tutorial Creator Strategy

YouTubers who post "how to use AI video tools" content are a high-priority target. They have built-in audiences of people learning AI video — exactly who we want on MooHive.

**Why they're valuable:**
- Already have engaged audiences interested in AI video
- Create educational content (aligns with our transparency values)
- Need somewhere to showcase their example outputs beyond video descriptions
- Their tutorials become funnels to MooHive

**What we offer them:**
| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Official portfolio** | A dedicated space to showcase all their tutorial outputs, organized and searchable |
| **Recognition** | Likes, features, "Top Creator" badges — social proof they can reference in videos |
| **Backlinks** | Every video on MooHive can link back to their YouTube tutorial |
| **Audience growth** | MooHive users discover their tutorials through their portfolio |

**The flywheel:**
```
YouTuber joins MooHive
        ↓
Adds portfolio link to video descriptions ("See all my work on MooHive")
        ↓
Tutorial viewers visit MooHive
        ↓
Viewers sign up, discover other creators
        ↓
MooHive grows → more eyeballs on YouTuber's portfolio
        ↓
YouTuber promotes MooHive more
```

**Outreach approach:**
- Watch their recent tutorial, note something specific
- DM or email: "Your [specific video] was great. We're building a portfolio platform for AI video creators — would love for you to be a founding creator. You'd have a place to showcase all your tutorial outputs, and we'd feature you to our community."
- Offer early "Verified Creator" or "Educator" badge

**Target channels (examples of the type):**
- Channels with 5K-100K subscribers focused on Runway, Pika, Kling tutorials
- Creators who post comparison videos (Runway vs Kling vs Pika)
- Workflow/technique channels showing advanced AI video methods

**Success criteria:** 100 creators with at least 3 videos each, actively engaging with each other's work.

#### Reddit Community Strategy

Reddit hosts numerous active communities where AI video creators gather. These are prime hunting grounds for early adopters.

**Primary subreddits (highest priority):**

| Subreddit | Members | Focus |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| r/aivideo | 320k+ | Dedicated AI video community — our core audience |
| r/StableDiffusion | 1M+ | Huge AI art community, many doing video work |
| r/midjourney | 1.1M+ | Massive crossover audience moving into AI video |
| r/runwayml | — | Tool-specific, highly engaged users |

**Tool-specific subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| r/OpenAI | Sora discussions and showcases |
| r/SoraAI | Dedicated Sora community |
| r/KlingAI | Kling-specific content and tips |
| r/LumaAI | Luma Dream Machine users |
| r/pikalabs | Pika-specific community |

**Broader creative/technical communities:**

| Subreddit | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| r/aiArt | 190k+ members — general AI art, video gets shared |
| r/generativeart | Creative AI community, appreciates process transparency |
| r/VideoEditing | Traditional editors increasingly adopting AI tools |
| r/filmmakers | Professionals experimenting with AI for production |
| r/ArtificialIntelligence | Broader AI community, video showcases get attention |
| r/LocalLlama | Technical crowd running local models — some doing video |
| r/DeepDream | Machine learning art enthusiasts |

**Engagement approach:**
- Be genuinely helpful first — answer questions, share knowledge, troubleshoot issues
- Share MooHive only when directly relevant (e.g., "where can I showcase my work?")
- Never spam or self-promote in comments unrelated to the topic
- Build reputation over weeks before mentioning MooHive
- Upvote and engage with great creator work (potential outreach targets)

**What to look for:**
- Creators posting "finally finished my first AI video" — reach out via DM
- Threads asking "where do you share your AI videos?" — natural MooHive mention
- Frustration posts about showcasing on X/Twitter — our value prop resonates here
- Technique questions — demonstrate expertise, then soft-mention MooHive

---

### Phase 2: First 1,000 Creators (Traction)

**Goal:** Establish MooHive as the go-to destination for serious AI video creators.

**Strategy: Social proof + content flywheel**

| Tactic | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Creator spotlights** | Weekly features of standout work shared across all channels. Creators share their features → exposure to their audience. |
| **Tool-specific collections** | Curated galleries: "Best of Runway," "Kling Showcase," etc. Creators want to be included → they join and upload. |
| **Technique breakdowns** | Partner with top creators to do deep-dives on their process. Educational content that drives traffic. |
| **Cross-promotion** | Encourage creators to add MooHive links to their X/YouTube bios. Provide nice-looking portfolio cards they can share. |
| **SEO foundation** | Creator profiles and video pages optimized for "[creator name] AI video" and "[tool name] examples" searches. |

**Amplification loops:**
1. Creator uploads video → MooHive shares on X with credit → Creator reshares → Their followers discover MooHive
2. Creator gets featured → Adds "Featured on MooHive" to bio → Social proof attracts peers
3. Technique post ranks on Google → New creator discovers → Signs up to learn more
4. YouTuber links portfolio in video description → Viewers visit MooHive → Discover other creators → Follow YouTuber on MooHive → Click through to more of their YouTube content

**Success criteria:** 1,000 creators, 50+ weekly active uploaders, organic signups exceeding outreach-driven signups.

---

### Phase 3: 10,000+ Creators (Scale)

**Goal:** Become the default portfolio platform for anyone serious about AI video.

**Strategy: Network effects + category ownership**

| Tactic | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Referral program** | Creators invite creators. Reward: extended features, visibility boosts, or early access to new tools. |
| **Tool partnerships** | Partner with AI video tools (Runway, Pika, etc.) for "Share to MooHive" integrations or co-marketing. |
| **Events & competitions** | Weekly sponsored competitions with tool company partners. See dedicated "Sponsored Competitions" section below. |
| **Press & thought leadership** | Position MooHive as the source for AI video trends. Journalists come to us for creator quotes and examples. |
| **Creator success stories** | Document creators who got hired or gained recognition through MooHive. Proof that the platform delivers value. |

**When to introduce the hirer side:**
- After 5,000+ active creators with diverse, high-quality portfolios
- When we have enough content to make discovery genuinely useful
- When creators start asking "how do I get hired through this?"

**Success criteria:** 10,000+ creators, self-sustaining growth, recognized as the AI video community hub.

## SEO Strategy

SEO is a primary acquisition channel. People searching "how to create AI videos" or "best Runway examples" are exactly who we want. Unlike social, search traffic compounds over time.

### Target Keywords

**High-intent learning queries:**
| Query Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Tool tutorials | "how to use Runway Gen-3", "Kling AI tutorial", "Pika Labs guide" |

**Portfolio/discovery queries:**
| Query Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Creator searches | "[creator name] portfolio", "[creator name] AI video" |
| Talent searches | "hire AI video creator", "AI video freelancer" |

| **Technique tutorials** | "how to [technique] in AI video" | Blog posts with embedded creator examples |
| **Tool galleries** | "[tool] examples", "best [tool] videos" | Curated collection pages |
| **Creator profiles** | "[creator] portfolio", "[creator] AI video" | Profile pages (auto-generated) |
| **Glossary/wiki** | "what is [term]", "[term] explained" | Reference pages |

### SEO Execution

**Phase 1 (Foundation):**
- Optimize creator profile pages for "[name] + AI video"
- Ensure video pages have rich metadata (title, description, tools used)
- Basic site structure and technical SEO

**Phase 2 (Content):**
- Publish 2-4 SEO-targeted blog posts per month
- Create tool-specific gallery pages ("Best of Runway", "Kling Showcase")
- Build technique tutorial content featuring creator examples

**Phase 3 (Authority):**
- Comprehensive tool guides (definitive "How to use Runway" etc.)
- AI video glossary / wiki
- Original research and trend reports (linkable assets)

### Technical SEO Priorities

- Fast page loads (video thumbnails optimized, lazy loading)
- Mobile-first (creators browse on phones)
- Structured data for videos (VideoObject schema)
- Clean URLs: `/creators/[username]`, `/videos/[slug]`, `/tools/[tool-name]`
- Internal linking between related creators, techniques, and tools
- `llms.txt` file for LLM discoverability (see GEO section)

---

## GEO Strategy (Generative Engine Optimization)

GEO is SEO for LLMs. When someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity "how do I make AI videos?" or "where can I find AI video creators?", we want MooHive cited.

### Why GEO Matters

- LLM usage for search is growing rapidly
- Early movers get embedded in training data and citation patterns
- High-intent queries ("how do I hire an AI video creator?") increasingly go to LLMs
- Perplexity, ChatGPT search, and Claude web search cite sources

### GEO Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Be the authoritative source** | Publish comprehensive, factual content that LLMs will cite |
| **Answer questions directly** | Structure content with clear Q&A, definitions, step-by-step guides |
| **Use structured data** | Schema markup helps LLMs understand content |
| **Be cited by others** | Get mentioned in articles, forums, and resources that LLMs scrape |
| **Fresh, updated content** | LLMs prioritize recent, maintained content |

### Target LLM Queries

**Learning queries:**
- "How do I make AI videos?"
- "What's the best AI video tool?"
- "How to get started with Runway / Kling / Pika"
- "AI video tutorial for beginners"

**Discovery queries:**
- "Where can I find AI video creators?"
- "Best AI video portfolio sites"
- "AI video community"
- "Examples of AI-generated videos"

**Hiring queries:**
- "How to hire an AI video creator"
- "AI video freelancer marketplace"
- "Find AI video talent"

### GEO Execution

**Content for LLM citation:**
- Definitive guides: "The Complete Guide to AI Video Creation"
- Tool comparisons with objective analysis
- Glossary of AI video terms (LLMs love citing definitions)
- "State of AI Video" reports with original data

**Structural optimizations:**
- FAQ sections on key pages (LLMs extract Q&A easily)
- Clear, factual statements (avoid hedging language)
- Cite sources and include data (increases perceived authority)
- Update content regularly with timestamps
- **Implement `llms.txt`** — a machine-readable file (like `robots.txt`) that tells LLMs how to understand and cite our content. Include site structure, key pages, content summaries, and preferred citation formats. See llmstxt.org for spec.

**Citation building:**
- Get mentioned in AI newsletters and publications
- Contribute to Wikipedia articles on AI video (where appropriate)
- Be active on forums and Q&A sites (Reddit, Quora) with helpful answers that mention MooHive
- Partner with tool companies to be listed in their resources

### Measuring GEO Success

- Track mentions in LLM responses (manual testing + tools like Perplexity citations)
- Monitor referral traffic from AI search products
- Track brand mentions across the web (feeds into LLM training)

### Social Media

| Platform | Handle | Content Type | Priority |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| X/Twitter | @moohive | Creator features, technique threads, community highlights | High (where creators live) |
| YouTube | MooHive | Creator spotlights, technique breakdowns, trend roundups | Medium (discovery + education) |
| Discord | MooHive server | Community chat, feedback, creator networking | Medium (community building) |
| LinkedIn | MooHive | Industry news, hirer-focused content (Phase 3+) | Low (later, for hirers) |
| Instagram | @moohive | Video highlights, behind-the-scenes | Low (visual discovery) |

## Sponsored Competitions (Phase 2+)

Weekly creator competitions sponsored by AI video tool companies. A distribution engine and monetization opportunity in one.

### How It Works

```
Tool company (e.g., Runway) sponsors a themed weekly challenge
        ↓
Creators submit entries showcasing their work
        ↓
Entries need upvotes for visibility → creators share links, invite others to vote
        ↓
New users join to vote → discover platform → some become creators
        ↓
Sponsor judges winners, awards prizes
        ↓
MooHive charges platform fee to sponsor
```

### Value for Each Party

| Party | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Sponsors** | Showcase their tool's capabilities, engage power users, brand exposure, collect UGC for marketing |
| **Creators** | Prize money, recognition, motivation to create, exposure to sponsor and community |
| **MooHive** | Platform fee revenue, viral sharing via upvote mechanic, recurring engagement, new user acquisition |

### Competition Structure

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Cadence** | Weekly, with rotating sponsors |
| **Themes** | Tool-specific ("Best Runway Gen-4 character animation") or technique-based ("Most creative use of lip sync") |
| **Entry** | Submit video + brief description of tools/process used |
| **Voting** | Community upvotes determine visibility; sponsor judges select winners from top entries |
| **Prizes** | Cash, tool credits, featured placement, "Competition Winner" badge |

### The Viral Loop

The upvote requirement is the distribution engine:
- Creators share entry links on X, Discord, Reddit to gather votes
- Friends/followers click through → discover MooHive
- Some vote and leave, others explore → sign up → become creators
- More creators = more competition entries = more sharing

### Monetization

| Fee Type | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Platform fee** | Flat fee or percentage of prize pool charged to sponsor |
| **Premium placement** | Sponsors can pay extra for homepage takeover, email feature, etc. |
| **Recurring packages** | Discounted rates for sponsors committing to multiple weeks |

### Launch Criteria

Don't launch until:
- 1,000+ active creators (enough participation to make competitions compelling)
- Proven engagement patterns (creators returning weekly)
- At least one tool company has expressed interest

### Example Competition

> **Week 12: Kling AI Character Challenge**
>
> *Sponsored by Kling*
>
> Create a 10-second character animation using Kling. Show us emotion, movement, personality.
>
> **Prizes:** 1st: $500 + 1 year Kling Pro | 2nd: $250 + 6 months Kling Pro | 3rd: $100 + 3 months Kling Pro
>
> **Judging:** Top 20 by upvotes reviewed by Kling team. Winners announced Friday.

---

## Referral Program (Phase 2+)

### Mechanics

- **Trigger:** Creator invites another creator who signs up and uploads 1+ video
- **Reward (inviter):** Portfolio visibility boost for 1 week, "Community builder" badge
- **Reward (invitee):** Featured in "New creators" section

### Why not monetary?

- Attracts quality over quantity
- Aligned with community values (generous, not transactional)
- Creates genuine advocacy, not mercenary referrals

### Tracking

- Unique referral links per creator
- Dashboard showing invites sent, converted, rewards earned

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Creators don't see value vs. posting on X | Emphasize portfolio curation, process transparency, discoverability. Make it complement X, not replace it. |
| Cold start (empty platform) | Seed with founding creators before public launch. Never launch to an empty feed. |
| Low engagement after signup | Onboarding flow encourages immediate upload. Regular prompts and features keep creators active. |
| Tool communities resist promotion | Be genuinely helpful first. Earn the right to mention MooHive. Never spam. |
| Copycats / competition | Move fast, build community moat. Relationships with creators are the defensible asset. |

---

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Pre-launch | 4-6 weeks | Waitlist, outreach, early access | 50 founding creators |
| Phase 1 | 2-3 months | Seed community | 100 active creators |
| Phase 2 | 6-9 months | Traction, content flywheel | 1,000 creators, organic growth |
| Phase 3 | 12+ months | Scale, introduce hirer side | 10,000+ creators, network effects |
