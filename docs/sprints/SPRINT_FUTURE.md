# Future Ideas (Not Committed)

> Ideas to capture for potential future consideration — definitely not before initial launch, potentially never. But worth documenting so they're not lost.

**Status:** 💭 Speculative
**Priority:** None — these are not on the roadmap

## Ideas

### Multi-Format AI Creator Platform

**What if MooHive wasn't just for AI video creators?**

What if we grew beyond the video format and became THE place for AI creators to flock, showcase, share, and get hired? i.e., what if we also opened up to:

- **Images** — AI-generated artwork, concept art, illustrations
- **Audio/Music** — AI-composed tracks, sound design, voice synthesis
- **Games and Apps** — AI-assisted game design, interactive experiences

#### Potential Benefits
- Larger addressable market
- Natural overlap between image, audio, and video creation
- Position as the definitive AI creator hub across all formats
- Cross-pollination between different creator types

#### Risks
- **Dilution risk** — lose our edge by trying to be everything to everyone
- Harder to maintain quality bar across multiple formats
- Each format has different metadata, discovery, and showcase needs
- More complex product and UX to build and maintain
- May confuse our positioning and brand identity

#### Notes
There is a somewhat natural overlap between image, audio, and video anyway — many AI video creators also work with images and audio. But the question is whether we want to be the focused, best-in-class platform for AI video, or the broader platform for all AI creativity.

**Decision:** Capture for future consideration. Launch focused on AI video first, validate the model, then consider expansion if it makes sense.
